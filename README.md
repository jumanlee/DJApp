# Introduction
My completed project for a DJ App using C++ with JUCE. My repo includes an mp4 video that showing the user how to use the DJ App and also a report explaining the code. This is the final project for my Object Oriented Programming course as part of my University of London degree. All the code is stored in the project folder. Wtihin the project folder, there's a "tracks" folder that contains some sample music tracks that you can use to test the DJ App. The mp4 is a video demonstrating the functionality of the DJ App.
